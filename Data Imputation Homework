Briefly describe the mechanisms of operation of four different data imputation methods.  
Using the iris dataset, randomly create missing values to occupy x% of the data. 
Use R to apply 3 different methods of imputation and compare their performance when x=2, 5, 10 , 15, 20, 25. 
Use the following methods to evaluate the performance of the methods: 
  1. Root mean square error (RMSE) between imputed and true values.
  2. Supervised classification error (Use k-NN classifier). 
Discuss your observations. 
Repeat the above process, albeit with the missing values not randomly created (Come up with your own scheme where some classes,
feature ids or features having a certain size have higher probability of having missing values. Be sure to explain your 
scheme and clearly show its implementation).
